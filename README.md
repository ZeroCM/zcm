# ZCM: Zero Communications and Marshalling

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZeroCM/zcm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ZeroCM/zcm)

ZCM is a micro-framework for message-passing and data-marshalling, designed originally
for robotics systems where high-bandwidth and low-latency are critical and the variance in
compute platforms is large.

ZCM is a publish/subscribe message-passing system with automatic message type-checking and
serialization. It provides bindings for a variety of programming languages, and generates
language-specific message serialization routines. Using a ZCM message feels natural
in each language.

ZCM is transport-agnostic. There is no required built-in transport. Every transport is
first-class. This is achieved by defining strict blocking and non-blocking transport APIs. As
long as a transport implementation conforms to this API, it should work flawlessly with ZCM.
This design allows ZCM to work well on anything from a high-end posix-based compute cluster
with thousands of nodes to a low-end real-time embedded-system with no operating system.

ZCM is a derivation of the [LCM project](http://lcm-proj.github.io/) created in 2006 by
the MIT DARPA Urban Challenge team. The core message-type system, publish/subscribe APIs,
and basic tools are ported directly from LCM and remain about 95% compatible. While there
are a handful of subtle differences between the two, the core distinguishing feature is
ZCM's transport agnosticism. LCM is designed completely around UDP Multicast. This transport
makes a lot of sense for LAN connected compute clusters (such the original 2006 MIT DGC
Vechicle).  However, there are many other applications that are interesting targets for
ZCM messaging.  These include: local system messaging (IPC), multi-threaded messaging
(in-process), embedded-system peripherals (UART, I2C, etc), and web applications
(Web Sockets).  By refusing to make hard assumptions about the transport layer, ZCM opens
the door to a wide set of use-cases that were neither possible nor practical with LCM.

## Features
 - Type-safe and version-safe message serialization
 - A useful suite of tools for logging, log-playback, and real-time message inspection (spy)
 - A wide set of optionally built-in transports including UDP Multicast, IPC, In-Process, Serial, and ZeroMQ
 - A well-defined interface for building custom transports
 - Strong support for embedded applications. The core embedded code is restricted to C89.
 - Only one true dependency: A modern C++11 compiler for the non-embedded code.

## Supported platforms and languages
 - Platforms
  - GNU/Linux
  - Web browsers supporting the Websocket API
  - Any C89 capable embedded system
 - Languages
  - C89 and greater
  - C++
  - Java
  - MATLAB (using Java)
  - NodeJS and Client-side Javascript
  - Python
  - Julia

## Roadmap
 - Platform Support
   - Windows
   - OS X
   - Any POSIX-1.2001 system (e.g., Cygwin, Solaris, BSD, etc.)
 - Consider porting the rest of the LCM languages
   - C#
   - Lua
 - Explore alternative messaging paradigms using ZCM Types (e.g. those found in ZeroMQ)
 - Break from the original LCM APIs to improve API consistency
   - Goal for v2.0
   - v1.0 will **always** strive for API compatibility

## Subtle differences to LCM

ZCM is approximately 95% API compatible with LCM. Porting existing Unix-based LCM
programs to ZCM is very easy in many cases. A quick `sed -i 's/lcm/zcm/g'` works for
most applications. ZCM uses the same binary-compatible formats for UDP Multicast, Logging,
and ZCMType encodings. Thus LCM and ZCM applications can communicate flawlessly. This
allows LCM users to gradually migrate to ZCM.

### Known incompatibilities:
 - `zcm_get_fileno()` is not supported
 - `zcm_handle_timeout()` is not supported
 - Any applications using GLib via LCM may have build errors
   - ZCM does *not* depend on GLib
 - ZCMType drops support for the LCMType-style enums
